# Quantum Cryptography: Public Key Distribution and Coin Tossing

In this post, I want to revisit an old paper that goes by the acronym BB84 [^1]. The two Bs stand for the last names of the authors Bennett and Brassard, and 1984 was when they first presented their paper at the [Internaional Conference on Computers, Systems, and Signal Processing](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Proceedings_of_International_Conference.html?id=H0p0NQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y) held in Bangalore.

  
## Motivation
Before we begin, let me answer why I am interested in all this. There are two reasons:

1. It is interesting!

2. I've been thinking about multiparty entanglement for a while now, and I often wonder what is it good for? Does genuine multipartite entanglement allow me to design novel quantum routines that outperform, say, the routines that use only bipartite entanglement? In other words, is genuine multiparty entanglement operationally more useful than just bipartite entanglement? 

The literature on these issues is rather unclear. I came across no demonstrably single instance where a multipartite state, like the GHZ state 
\begin{equation}
| \text{GHZ} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |000\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |111\rangle,
\end{equation}
could outperform a bipartite state in any operational task. If you know of any such routines, I'd be very happy to know about them. The only paper that boasted such an advantage was one on **quantum conference key agreement** [^2]. This seemed interesting, and I decided I want to learn about conference key distribution. So you shouldn't be surprised if you see a few more posts where I rant about conference key agreement (often abbreviated as CKA). 

With that out of the way, we are ready to begin our voyage through BB84. 

## Introduction
Here's the problem we want to tackle. Alice and Bob need a secure communication channel. Alice probably has some top-secret information she needs to share with Bob. However, there is an Eve who is waiting to intercept any message that Alice and Bob send to each other. Alice and Bob therefore need to encrypt the messages they're sending and decrypt the messages they're receiving.

If the world wasn't quantum mechanical, we'd have resorted to something like the [RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)). However, such cryptosystems assume the existence of problems for which there are no known efficient solutions; for example, [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization). There is no proof that such problems can't be solved efficiently. If someone someday comes up with an efficient algorithm for prime factorization, it would [break the RSA cryptosystem](https://www.csoonline.com/article/570535/whats-next-for-encryption-if-the-rsa-algorithm-is-broken.html
). Therefore, classical cryptosystems, like the RSA, are not *provably* secure. They're probably secure, but we don't have a proof. 

An alternate strategy they could adopt is something like the [_Vernam cipher_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vernam-cipher-in-cryptography/). But to do this, they need to first establish a _key_. The BB84 protocol does exactly that. It allows Alice and Bob to establish a private key that they can then use for secure communication. Using quantum mechanics, they can ensure the eavesdropper Eve knows (almost) nothing about their private key.  The BB84 scheme is provably secure[^3]. Even when Eve has superior technology and unlimited computing power.
